# Power BI Dashboard: Financial Report with Bookmarks

This project is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built while learning through a **Udemy online course**.  
The course guided the base dashboard creation, and I enhanced it by adding **Bookmarks** and **Field Parameters** for interactivity.
